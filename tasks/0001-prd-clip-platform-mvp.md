# Product Requirements Document: "La Usina de la Fabrica de Jingles"

## Introduction/Overview

This platform provides a curated interface for accessing and analyzing specific YouTube clips ("Fabricas") from the show "La Fabrica de Jingles" by the streaming station Gelatina. Each video features several songs ("Jingles"), which are versions of known songs ("Canciones", by "Autor"). The Jingles are submitted by show audience, usually referred to as "Jingleros" (within our platform the both the Autor and the Jinglero information is store under the "Artistas" category). Each Jingle will be tagged with one or more Topics ("Tematicas") that are addressed in the Jingle.
The system provides an in-app reproduction of the videoclip from YouTube, while dynamically showing the information associated to the current song, that automatically changes when the user is reproducing another segment of the video. The user can interact with this content, opening panels to search for other instances matching some property (like other Jingles featuring the same song, or submitted by the same Jinglero, and provides a link to them).

This PRD is focusing on the MVP version of the platform.
The platform will utilize React for the frontend, Neo4j for the knowledge database, with initial local development and potential later deployment.

## MVP Scope and Data Scale

### Dataset Size

- **50-60 Fabricas** (complete video episodes)
- **1,300 Jingles** (individual performances with timestamps)
- **800 Canciones** (original songs)
- **1,000 Artistas** (performers and original artists)
- **500 Tematicas** (themes and topics)

**Note:** Sample dataset can start at ~5% of the full catalog for initial development and testing.

### MVP Deployment Target

- **Local development environment** for MVP
- Limited beta testing with target audience
- Future deployment to production hosting (Render/Vercel) post-MVP

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: Neo4j (AuraDB cloud or local instance)
- **Video**: YouTube embed API

## Goals

1. Create a Knowledge Database of the Fabricas, Jingles, Canciones, Artistas and Tematicas, with several relationships that will be exploited during the User Experience.
2. **Core MVP Goal**: Create a user experience to watch a YouTube video (from La Fabrica de Jingles) while accessing detailed information of the Jingle being displayed.
3. **Core MVP Goal**: Create an interface to search the Knowledge database, including predictive completion.
4. **Core MVP Goal**: Facilitate easy navigation and discovery of related content via the Knowledge Database relationships.
5. Create a responsive web interface accessible across devices.
6. Enable basic admin content curation workflow.

## Success Metrics

### MVP Launch Criteria (Limited Beta)

1. **Technical Readiness:**

   - Database fully populated with 50+ Fabricas, 1,300+ Jingles
   - Search returns results in <500ms
   - Video playback works reliably
   - Admin can add/edit content without errors

2. **Beta User Feedback Targets:**

   - Users can successfully search and find content
   - Users can watch Fabricas and see Jingle metadata updates
   - Users can navigate between related entities without confusion
   - No critical bugs or data errors reported

3. **Content Quality:**
   - All Fabricas have complete Jingle data
   - All Jingles have proper timestamps and metadata
   - All relationships are correctly established

### Post-MVP Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement:**
   - Session duration (target: 10+ minutes)
   - Fabrica completion rate (users watching full videos)
   - Click-through rate to related entities
2. **Content Growth:**
   - Number of new Fabricas added monthly
   - Coverage of full catalog (target: 100+ episodes)
3. **Feature Usage:**
   - Search query frequency and patterns
   - Most popular Jingles/Jingleros
   - User navigation paths through the knowledge graph

## Open Questions

1. **Future user authentication:** Multi-user system with roles (Admin, Member, Guest)
2. **Data curation workflow:** How frequently will new Fabricas/Jingles be added after MVP launch?
3. **Beta testing feedback:** What feedback mechanisms should be in place for limited beta users?
4. **Performance optimization:** With 1,300+ Jingles, what pagination/loading strategies are needed for search results?
5. **YouTube API considerations:** Rate limits, embedded player customization, alternate playback methods if YouTube embeds fail? Link out to YouTube.

## Data Requirements and Constraints

### Initial Seed Data

- Sample dataset: ~5-10% of full catalog for development
- Full dataset migration before MVP launch
- CSV import format defined in `/backend/src/server/db/import/`

### Database Constraints

- All entities require unique IDs
- Timestamps required on all entities and relationships
- Boolean flags for special designations (isJinglazo, isPrecario, isArg, etc.)
- Foreign key relationships enforced via Neo4j constraints

### Performance Considerations

- Search queries must handle 1,000+ entities efficiently
- Video thumbnail loading prioritized over full video buffering
- Pagination required for lists over 50 items
- Autocomplete debouncing and result limiting (10-20 items)
