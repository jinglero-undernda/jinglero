# Infrastructure

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed infrastructure documentation for different infrastructure areas (environments, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, etc.). Each infrastructure document specifies infrastructure definitions, provisioning processes, and management strategies.

## Infrastructure Documents

_Infrastructure documents will be created when documenting deployment using PLAYBOOK_01._

## Infrastructure Structure

Each infrastructure document should include:

1. **Metadata**
   - Infrastructure area and category
   - Status (draft | current_implementation | validated | implemented | deprecated)
   - Last updated date

2. **Infrastructure Definitions**
   - Infrastructure components
   - Infrastructure provisioning
   - Infrastructure management

3. **Code References**
   - Infrastructure code locations
   - Configuration locations
   - Example infrastructure patterns
