# Playbook 04: Plan Improvements

## Purpose

This playbook provides step-by-step instructions for planning incremental deployment improvements based on gap analysis. Use this to create improvement tasks with clear scope, assess risks, and identify dependencies.

## When to Use This Playbook

- After gap analysis (PLAYBOOK_03)
- Before implementing infrastructure (PLAYBOOK_05)
- When planning deployment improvement work
- When prioritizing deployment improvements

## Prerequisites

- Gap analysis report exists
- Prioritized gap list
- Understanding of codebase structure
- Access to deployment process documentation

## Instructions for AI Assistant

### Step 1: Review Gap Analysis

**Your task:**

1. Read the gap analysis report
2. Understand prioritized gaps
3. Identify dependencies between gaps
4. Group related gaps

**Create gap groups:**

```
Group 1: Deployment Process Improvements
- GAP-001: Missing deployment automation
- GAP-002: Deployment process issues

Group 2: Environment Configuration Improvements
- GAP-003: Missing environment variables
- GAP-004: Environment configuration issues
```

### Step 2: Define Improvement Scope

**For each gap or gap group, define scope:**

1. **What needs to change:**
   - Deployment improvements needed
   - Environment changes needed
   - Infrastructure changes needed
   - Documentation updates needed

2. **What should stay the same:**
   - Backward compatibility requirements
   - Existing functionality
   - User-facing behavior (unless deployment improvement)

3. **Boundaries:**
   - What's in scope
   - What's out of scope
   - What's deferred

**Scope template:**

```markdown
## Improvement Scope: [Gap Name/Group]

### In Scope

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Not changing 1]
- [Not changing 2]

### Deferred

- [Future change 1]
- [Future change 2]
```

### Step 3: Assess Dependencies

**Identify dependencies:**

1. **Code Dependencies:**
   - What code depends on current deployment?
   - What code will be affected by changes?
   - What needs to be updated together?

2. **Deployment Dependencies:**
   - What other deployment elements depend on this?
   - What deployment elements will be affected?
   - What needs to be updated together?

3. **Task Dependencies:**
   - What tasks must be done before this?
   - What tasks can be done in parallel?
   - What tasks depend on this?

**Dependency graph:**

```
Task A → Task B → Task C
Task D → Task E
Task F (independent)
```

### Step 4: Assess Risks

**For each improvement task, assess risks:**

1. **Technical Risks:**
   - Risk of breaking existing deployment
   - Risk of deployment regression
   - Risk of introducing bugs
   - Risk of complexity increase

2. **Deployment Risks:**
   - Risk of not meeting deployment goals
   - Risk of deployment regression
   - Risk of environment issues

3. **Infrastructure Risks:**
   - Risk of infrastructure failures
   - Risk of provisioning issues
   - Risk of management issues

4. **Timeline Risks:**
   - Risk of taking longer than estimated
   - Risk of blocking other work
   - Risk of scope creep

**Risk assessment template:**

```markdown
## Risk Assessment: [Task Name]

### Technical Risks

### Step 6: Create Improvement Plan

**Organize tasks into a plan:**

```markdown
# Improvement Plan: Deployment & Infrastructure

**Date Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Planner**: AI Assistant
**Target Completion**: [Date]

## Overview

- **Total Tasks**: [number]
- **Estimated Effort**: [hours/days]
- **Priority Breakdown**:
  - P0: [count] tasks
  - P1: [count] tasks
  - P2: [count] tasks
  - P3: [count] tasks

## Phase 1: Critical Improvements (P0)

**Goal**: Fix critical gaps that break deployment

**Tasks**:

1. [Task name] - [Effort] - [Dependencies]

**Timeline**: [Start date] - [End date]

## Phase 2: High Priority (P1)

**Goal**: Fix significant deployment issues

**Tasks**:

1. [Task name] - [Effort] - [Dependencies]

**Timeline**: [Start date] - [End date]

## Phase 3: Medium Priority (P2)

**Goal**: Address deployment improvements

**Tasks**:

1. [Task name] - [Effort] - [Dependencies]

**Timeline**: [Start date] - [End date]

## Phase 4: Low Priority (P3)

**Goal**: Cosmetic fixes and documentation

**Tasks**:

1. [Task name] - [Effort] - [Dependencies]

**Timeline**: [Start date] - [End date]

## Task Dependency Graph

[Visual or text representation of dependencies]

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### High Risk Tasks
- [Task name]: [Mitigation strategy]

### Medium Risk Tasks
- [Task name]: [Mitigation strategy]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All P0 tasks completed
- [ ] All P1 tasks completed
- [ ] Deployment processes met
- [ ] Infrastructure implemented
- [ ] Processes validated (PLAYBOOK_02)

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Review plan with stakeholders
2. [ ] Get approval on priorities
3. [ ] Begin Phase 1 (P0 tasks)
4. [ ] Use PLAYBOOK_05 for implementation
```

### Step 7: Estimate Effort

**For each task, estimate effort:**

**Factors to consider:**
- Complexity of changes
- Number of files to create/modify
- Infrastructure implementation complexity
- Testing requirements
- Risk level

**Effort categories:**
- **Small**: 1-4 hours (simple changes, few files)
- **Medium**: 4-16 hours (moderate changes, multiple files)
- **Large**: 16+ hours (complex changes, many files, high risk)

**Estimation template:**

```markdown
## Effort Estimate: [Task Name]

**Breakdown**:

- Deployment changes: [hours]
- Infrastructure implementation: [hours]
- Testing: [hours]
- Documentation: [hours]

**Total**: [hours] ([Small | Medium | Large])

**Confidence**: High | Medium | Low
**Notes**: [Any assumptions or uncertainties]
```

### Step 8: Create Task Tracking

**Create a tracking document:**

```markdown
## Improvement Task Tracking

| Task ID  | Description   | Priority | Status  | Assigned | Effort | Dependencies | Notes |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ------------ | ----- |
| TASK-001 | [Description] | P0       | Planned | -        | Small  | -            | -     |
| TASK-002 | [Description] | P1       | Planned | -        | Medium | TASK-001     | -     |
```

## Output Deliverables

1. **Improvement Plan** (comprehensive document)
2. **Individual Task Definitions** (detailed tasks)
3. **Task Tracking** (ongoing tracking)
4. **Risk Assessment** (risk mitigation strategies)

## Quality Criteria

**Good improvement plan:**
- ✅ Clear scope for each task
- ✅ Dependencies identified
- ✅ Risks assessed and mitigated
- ✅ Realistic effort estimates
- ✅ Actionable tasks

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Vague task descriptions
- ❌ Missing dependencies

```

## Next Steps

After planning:
1. **Review plan** → Get stakeholder approval
2. **Begin implementation** → Use PLAYBOOK_05
3. **Track progress** → Update task tracking regularly
