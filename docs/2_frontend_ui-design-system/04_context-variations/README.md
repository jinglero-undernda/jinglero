# Context Variations

## Purpose

This section documents how components and design elements vary based on context (admin vs public), entity types, interaction states, and responsive breakpoints.

## Structure

### Context Types

1. **Admin Context** (`admin-context.md`) - Variations specific to admin interface
2. **Entity Context** (`entity-context.md`) - Variations based on entity type
3. **Interaction States** (`interaction-states.md`) - Hover, active, disabled, etc.
4. **Responsive Variations** (`responsive-variations.md`) - Breakpoint-specific changes

## Documentation Approach

When documenting context variations:

1. Identify the base design element
2. Document what changes in each context
3. Provide code references showing the variation
4. Explain when to use each variation

## Usage

Context variations may override or extend base design tokens and component styles. They ensure components adapt appropriately to different contexts while maintaining design system consistency.
