# Infrastructure

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed infrastructure documentation for different infrastructure areas (environments, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, etc.). Each infrastructure document specifies infrastructure definitions, provisioning processes, and management strategies.

## Infrastructure Documents

- **`raspberry-pi-deployment.md`** - Complete deployment process for Raspberry Pi 3B
- **`environments.md`** - Environment configuration for production deployment
- **`hardware.md`** - Hardware infrastructure specifications and management
- **`deployment-overview.md`** - High-level deployment overview and summary

## Infrastructure Structure

Each infrastructure document should include:

1. **Metadata**

   - Infrastructure area and category
   - Status (draft | current_implementation | validated | implemented | deprecated)
   - Last updated date

2. **Infrastructure Definitions**

   - Infrastructure components
   - Infrastructure provisioning
   - Infrastructure management

3. **Code References**
   - Infrastructure code locations
   - Configuration locations
   - Example infrastructure patterns
