- [Database Performance](./database-performance.md) - Database query performance targets, metrics, and monitoring
- [Frontend Performance](./frontend-performance.md) - Frontend application performance targets, metrics, and monitoring

## Metrics Structure

   - Status (draft | current_implementation | validated | implemented | deprecated)
   - Last updated date

2. **Performance Targets**
   - Target metrics
   - Target values
   - Measurement methods

3. **Current Metrics**
   - Current performance metrics
   - Metric definitions
   - Baseline measurements

4. **Code References**
   - Monitoring code locations
   - Metric collection locations
   - Example monitoring patterns
